# Motivation:
To compare different frameworks and to see which would give me the best result. I figured the best way to test this out would be to create identical Applications using those both frameworks.


# Motivation:
Why Flask over Django or Flask over Django?? That is the question. Flask offers a clean slate with no added features just a bare bone framework. Metaphoricaly it's like an openfield; there's space, materials, and freedom. It doesnt overwhelm, but it gives you the flexiblity to create anything with its huge set of external libraries and add-ons. It's a perfect for beginners, but Django on the other hand is like a city; It has rules, security, and is very scalable if done right, but the only downside is the learning curve just like any Isekai anime main character, they must learn the customs and rules before they can truely experience what all Django has to offer. personally, I prefer Flask for meticulous projects where I need scalpel precision or smaller projects that dont require massive overhead, but for larger projects are prefer Django for its scalability, Database flexibility, and Admin GUI.
